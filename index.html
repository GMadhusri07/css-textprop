        Satyendra Nath Bose( 1 January 1894 – 4
        February 1974) was an Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics">theoretical physicist</a> and mathematician. He
        is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in
        developing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics, and the theory
        of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate">Bose–Einstein condensate</a>. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was
        awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in
        1954 by the Government of India. 
        <p>The class of particles that
        obey Bose statistics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson">bosons</a>, was named after Bose by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Paul Dirac.</a></p>
       

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">A polymath</a>, he had a wide range of interests in varied fields, including
        physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts,
        literature, and music. He served on many research and development
        committees in India, after independence.<sup style="color:blue">[10]</sup></p>

 <hr>
 Bose, along with Indian Astrophysicist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghnad_Saha"> Meghnad Saha, </a>presented several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, whilst a Reader in the Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck's quantum radiation law</a> without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles.  
     <h4 style="text-indent:10px">Planck's law</h4>

   <div class="sidebyside2">In physics, Planck's law (also Planck radiation law[1]: 1305 ) describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature T, when there is no net flow of matter or energy between the body and its environment.[2].Every physical body spontaneously and continuously emits electromagnetic radiation and the spectral radiance of a body, Bν, describes the spectral emissive power per unit area, per unit solid angle and per unit frequency for particular radiation frequencies. Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a wavelength that depends on the temperature of the body. For example, at room temperature (~300 K), a body emits thermal radiation that is mostly infrared and invisible.</div>
